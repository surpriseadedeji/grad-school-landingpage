## New Things I've Learned
Working on this project has been both challenging and rewarding, contributing significantly to my growth as a developer. Some key things I've learned include:
- **Flexbox Layouts:** I now understand how to use Flexbox properly to align and distribute space among items in a container.
- **Transform Translate Property:** I learned how to use the `transform: translate` property to position elements efficiently without affecting the document flow.
- **Content Property in CSS:** I gained experience with the `content: ''` property, particularly in creating pseudo-elements for adding decorative content.
- **Responsive Design:** I was able to make a fully responsive website using only CSS and HTML by utilizing media queries effectively. This was my first time implementing a complex responsive design on my own, which has improved my confidence in working with front-end web development.
